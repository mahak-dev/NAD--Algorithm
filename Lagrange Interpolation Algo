1. Start

2. Read number of data (n)

3. Read data Xi and Yi for i=1 ton n

4. Read value of independent variables say xp
   whose corresponding value of dependent say yp is to be determined.
   
5. Initialize: yp = 0

6. For i = 1 to n
     Set p = 1
     For j =1 to n
       If i ≠ j then 
         Calculate p = p * (xp - Xj)/(Xi - Xj)
       End If
     Next j
     Calculate yp = yp + p * Yi
   Next i

6. Display value of yp as interpolated value.

7. Stop
